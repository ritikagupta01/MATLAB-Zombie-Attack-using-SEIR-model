World War Z: An Alternate Ending Using Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) Model

Project work done as part of the coursework for the course Mathematical Modeling.

In this project, our aim is to explore the dynamics of a hypothetical zombie outbreak in the absence of a vaccination strategy. While the film 'World War Z' shows that the characters ultimately discovered a
vaccine, our objective is to simulate an alternative scenario where no vaccine exists. By doing so, we will explore the dynamics of the disease's spread and attempt to create an alternative ending to the film.
